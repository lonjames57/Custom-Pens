This is a partial website for lon's custom pens. You can choose your pen style, components and acrylic color or wood type. 

The final page is completely interactive, and you can see a graphic representation of your choices at the top of the page.

You can make any changes on this page and the graphic will update with those changes.

The "Send to Cart" button does NOT work yet, so when that gets fixed the site will go live at: lonscustompens.com
