    <p><h2>I have been involved in computer graphics for most of my life. I enjoy making designs that are pleasing and that has spurred my love for making pens.The patterns I see as each pen takes shape are fun and interesting. I don't just want to make pens, I want to make pens that people want!
<br><br>
    I make each pen by hand, according to your specifications. It's really quite easy. You choose the <b><i>STYLE</i></b> of pen you desire, your choice of <b><i>metal finish</i></b>, and if you want a <b><i>wood or acrylic</i></b> body. I take care of everything else.
<br><br>
Please note that I am NOT a warehouse or supplier, so I have to order the supplies for every pen. That means in addition to my time of actually making the pen, I have to wait for supplies to be shipped to me.  This means I cannot make any "expedited" or emergency pens.</h2></p> <p style="color: rgb(189, 8, 8)"><font size="6"><b>You should allow <u>two weeks</u> from the order time for completion of your pen. I will usually be done well before that but I have no control over other companies shipping policies.</b></font></p> <p><h2>I promise to keep you appraised of any delays or problems.<br><br>

Your email is very important, as that is how I will contact you. I do not share my client list with anyone for any reason so you can rest assured that you will not be put on anyone elseâ€™s e-mail lists! You may also e-mail me with any requests or questions. I will be happy to answer them.
